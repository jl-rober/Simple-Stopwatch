Summary

I didnâ€™t have a whole lot of time to put into this exercise. But I wanted to create sort of a widget where you could easily include a JS file and use a single HTML element and have it automatically added to the page, and to where you could just specify the width of the container and have it automatically figure out the size. This worked for the most part, other than the text. It's difficult to get text to scale with the containers width, so currently it's just set to scale the text based on the overall width of the page using CSS breakpoints (could also set it using vw, but this seemed to work better). If I had more time to put into this I could have created JS to automatically size the text based on the containers width, but if I was going to do that I would just use a library.

I knew setInterval wasn't all that accurate, especially when the tab is running in the background, so I have setInterval checking the time and comparing it to the time when the stopwatch was started, and then rounding that and incrementing it in 6 degree per second segments. Could easily modify it to update more frequently, and include the milliseconds on the digital output. This should be very precise though.
UPDATE: I changed it to update the rotation much more frequently to give it a fluid rotation

(Bug I ran into) For the analog portion of the stopwatch I wanted the hand to be a smooth transition around, so I tried setting the CSS transition to 1s linear, but ran into a variety of issues with this. On Firefox for some reason it would stutter back and forth constantly, although on most other browsers it seemed to work fine. I think this was due to the way Firefox processes transitions. I think every once in a while the setInterval method would run a little early, like a few milliseconds, and this would cause it to update the transform while it was still in the middle of a transition. All other browsers seemed to handle this fine, but with Firefox it's like it transitioned from the original transform, and not the most recently updated one. I think if I had more time I could figure out a solution to this. Worst case scenario is I could just create my own animation using JS. CSS animations are nice and easy, but situations like this make me wish you had more control over them.
UPDATE: I actually just changed the interval period and had it update the rotation of the clock hand much more frequently and that appears to work.

I also added the ability to specify different aspects of the stopwatch. You can choose to display only analog or digital by specifying a classname. If you add a classname of "digital" to the stopwatch, it will only display digital. Same with adding a classname of "analog". If these are omitted, it will display both. By default it will show the centiseconds (I think that's it), but if you add a class of "hours" it will display hours instead.

The instructions said to include a Resume button, but for my stopwatch the Start button performs this functionality. I could add another button titled Resume and just have it trigger the start button, but this seemed kind of redundant.
